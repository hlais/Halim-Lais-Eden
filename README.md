Unity Editor 2019.4.25f1
Following was applied:

There must be a 3D room in the scene - it can be a fixed size and can be viewed from a fixed angle.
There must be a rectangular table in the middle of the room with adjustable length.
Chairs must be placed at equal intervals along the length of the table - as many as can fit without overlapping or going beyond the ends of the table.
There must be some UI to allow adjustment of the length of the table. When the length is adjusted, the number of chairs must automatically update to fit the new length.
The table and chairs must not clip through the walls of the room.
 
Nice to have:
Add a text field in the UI to enter a colour hex code. The colour should then be applied to the table and chairs.
If no colour is entered, then revert back to a default colour.
Add a button that prints some JSON to the console with the length of the table, the number of chairs, and the colour hex.
